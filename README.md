# Features:
- Built in "holiday karma" system to determine if players are "naughty or nice"
- Exports to add/remove holiday karma from players. You can implement this into various jobs on your server
  - Ex: Garbage collection increases karma
  - Ex: Committing crime reduces karma
- Spawn Santa Claus where players can speak to him to check if they are on the naughty or nice list
- Spawn Christmas Trees around the server where players can check each of them once per script restart for presents
- Set present loot pools based on naughty or nice status
- Built in admin menu allowing admins to modify holiday karma for players in realtime

### **Why no present items?**
I figured that there's a large chance some players in servers will "horde" their presents after the holidays. Most devs/owners will remove this script after the holiday seasons. With that, it would make the presents useless. With it giving players items as they check the tree, we can gaurantee they get their "rewards" as soon as they look for presents under each tree.

## Happy Holidays from xT Development!
